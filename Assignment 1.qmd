When working with the data set, I noticed that there were some missing data points; for instance, in highincome, votekmt_nm, and income. I also noticed that there are highly skewed variables like age. There is an overrepresented number of older adults compared to middle aged adults. There also seems to be duplicated results. There are many entries from different districts while some districts only have a couple entries. That may be because of the number of people in each district, or because of duplicated entries.

To deal with missing values, I used a code source to clean up the data and change every missing value which was represented by -9 or 99, to N/A. I did so by running a summary to see which variables were missing using colSums(is.na(teds_2016)). Then the dplyr package changed all the variables.

To compare different groups like Tondu, female, age and more we would first need to find out what each variable is. For example, female is binary because there is only the option of 1 or 2, male or female; this is the same for dpp, yes or no. Taiwanese and econ_worse are also binary. Other variables like age and income are continuous are number based. Edu is an ordinal variable because it can be ranked by education level. Next, the method used would be based on Tondu’s type. If Tondu was binary, I would use female and Tondu since they are both binary variables and run a bivariate analysis because there are only two variables with two options. A chi squared test would probably be the most useful for this variable interaction. To measure continuous and binary variables, like tondu and age, I would use a boxplot because you would be able to see how the age differs when Tondu is yes and when it is no. This is also a good way to show outliers because it would show up way outside of the boxed area. Since edu is an ordinal variable, a chi squared test would show if there’s an association or if the two variables are independent.

For votetsai, first we must identify what type of variable it is. It is a binary variable because it only has 1 or 0, did or did not vote for Tsai. A chi-squared test would be used to see if each variable is independent of each other.
